# Proposal (In Progress)

This proposal is a work in progress

## Goals

An overwhelming majority of Node.js Top-Level Committee membership believe that
the Node.js must have representation on the Foundation Board. This Proposal
suggests a Project membership structure that echoes that of the Corporate
membership and ensures that Node.js has a permanent Board Director seat.

## Classes of Membership

The Foundation shall have the following classes of membership:

1. Platinum Corporate Members
2. Gold Corporate Members
3. Silver Corporate Members
4. Platinum Project Members
5. Gold Project Members
6. Silver Project Members

## Conditions and Term of Membership

TBD

## Privileges of Platinum Corporate and Project Membership

* appoint one representative to serve as a Director
* eligibility for the Director representative it appoints to the Board to run
  for election as the chairperson of the Board (the "Chairperson") or Vice
  Chairperson of the Board the "Vice Chairperson");
* all rights provided in Section 2.5(c) below; and
* such other rights as the Board of Directors may from time to time approve.

## Privileges of Gold Corporate and Project Membership

* nominate a representative to run for election and be elected and serve as a
  Director
* vote, together with all other Gold Members as a class (either Corporate or
  Project), for Directors
* all rights provided in Section 2.5(c) below; and
* such other rights as the Board of Directors may from time to time approve.

## Privileges of Silver Corporate and Project Membership

* nominate a representative to run for election and be elected and serve as a
  Director
* vote, together with all other Silver Members as a class (either Corporate or 
  Project), for Directors
* appoint one voting representative, on a one vote per Member basis, to each
  Member Committee (for example, a Marketing Committee, Finance Committee,
  etc.) other than the Technical Steering Committee; and
* such other rights as the Board of Directors may from time to time approve.

## Number of Directors

The total number of Directors shall be a least one and not more than two (2)
times the number Platinum Members (Corporate and Project), less one.

* Each Platinum Member (Corporate and Project) shall be entitled to appoint one
  Director (each a "Platinum Director"). Each Platinum Director shall serve
  until their successor shall be duly appointed or until their earlier
  resignation or removal.
* For each class of Gold Member (Project and Corporate):
  * At the time of any election of Directors where there is at least one
    (1) Gold Member in good standing, each Gold Member in good standing shall
    have the right to vote, together with any other Gold Members as a class, to
    elect that number of Directors equal to the lesser of (i) the number of
    Gold Members then in good standing divided by three (3), rounded down to
    the nearest whole number, and (ii) that number of Directors equal to the
    number of Platinum Directors then being appointed or in office, less three
    (3); provided that regardless of the foregoing, the Gold Member(s) shall
    always be entitled a minimum of one Director, and a maximum of three (3)
    directors (each such Director being referred to as a "Gold Director"). In
    the event that there are two Gold Members, each desiring to vote for its
    own nominee, the winner shall be determined by a coin toss. Prior to the
    first annual action of Members, the initial Gold Director(s) shall be
    elected at a time approved by the Board. Each Gold Director shall serve
    until their successor is elected and qualified or until their earlier
    resignation or removal. The selection of nominees for such position(s)
    shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the
    Board from time to time.
* For each class of Silver Member (Project and Corporate):
  * At the time of any election of Directors where there are at least ten (10)
    Silver Members in good standing, each Silver Member in good standing shall
    have the right to vote, together with the other Silver Members as a class,
    to elect the least of (i) three (3) Directors, (ii) that number of
    Directors equal to the number of Silver Members then in good standing
    divided by ten (10) (rounded down to the nearest whole number), and (iii)
    that number of Directors equal to the number of Platinum Directors then
    being appointed or in office, less the number of Gold Directors then being
    appointed or in office, less three (3) (each such Director being referred
    to as a "Silver Director"). Prior to the first annual action of Members,
    the initial Silver Director(s) shall be elected at a time approved by the
    Board. Each Silver Director shall serve in accordance with Sections 4.3(f)
    and 4.3(h) below and until their successor is elected and qualified or
    until their earlier resignation or removal. The selection of nominees
    for such position(s) shall be performed under such nominating procedures as
    may be set by the Board from time to time.
* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that
  after any election of Directors, the number of Platinum Members decreases or
  the number of Gold Members increases, and such decrease or increase, as the
  case may be, causes a situation where the number of Silver Directors
  previously elected exceeds the number of Platinum Directors then being
  appointed or in office less the number of Gold Directors then being appointed
  or in office less three (3), then in such event the Silver Directors
  previously elected may serve until the next annual election of Directors, at
  which time the required decrease in the number of Silver Directors shall take
  effect. If the terms of a sufficient number of Silver Directors are not
  expiring as of the date of such election, the selection of the Silver
  Director to resign shall be determined by such procedures as may be set by
  the Board of Directors from time to time.
* Any Director nominated, appointed or elected by any class of Members, or by
  any Member, may, but shall not automatically, be re-nominated, re-appointed
  and/or re-elected for additional terms.

* Each Corporate Director shall be an employee of the Member (or a Related
  Company) which nominated or appointed them at the time of such appointment or
  nomination.
* Each Project Director shall be a collaborator of the Project which nominated
  or appointed them at the time of such appointment or nomination.
* Each Director shall hold office until the earliest to occur of the expiration
  of the term for which such Director was appointed or elected and such
  Directorâ€™s successor is appointed or elected and qualified, or until their
  earlier death, resignation, removal, and in the case of a Platinum, Gold or
  Silver Director, until the earlier of (i) expiration or termination of
  Membership of the Member that nominated or appointed such Director, (ii) the
  combination, by merger, acquisition or otherwise, of two Members that each
  have representatives on the Board, upon which event one of the two
  representatives, as designated by the surviving Member, shall be deemed to
  have resigned, or (iii) if requested by the Board or the employer of such
  Director, upon the termination of the employment of such Director by the
  Member that nominated or appointed such Director. In addition, during such
  times as the Membership of any Member that has a representative serving as a
  Director is suspended pursuant to Section 2.11 above, the attendance and
  voting rights of such Director representative shall also be suspended until
  such time, if ever, as the suspension of such Member is lifted.
* Each Platinum, Gold or Silver Director (or the Member that appointed or is
  the employer of such Director), the TSC, and the Individual Director may
  designate in writing (which designation may be withdrawn in writing at any
  time by such Director, Member, the TSC, or the Individual Director, as the
  case may be) an individual to act as a Director in their stead, whether
  for a single meeting or as a standing alternate. Any such alternate Director
  shall also be an employee of the Member that appointed or nominated the 
  original Director (except for the alternate of the TSC Director, the 
  alternative for whom shall be another member of the Technical Steering 
  Committee, and for the Individual Member, whose alternate shall be another 
  Individual Member). Any such alternate Director shall be entitled to (i) 
  attend and vote at all meetings which the designating Director does not 
  attend, (ii) sign all written consents in lieu of the designating Director, 
  and (iii) otherwise exercise the duties and enjoy the privileges of the 
  designating Director in the absence or unavailability of the designating 
  Director; provided, however, that no such alternate Director may propose a 
  vote or vote upon any Board Committee. In addition, in lieu of making such a 
  substitution, any Director who will be absent for any meeting may deliver a 
  written proxy to the Chairperson or Secretary, authorizing such Officer to 
  either vote as instructed in such proxy, or to vote in the stead of such 
  absent Director in such manner as such Officer may believe appropriate, 
  consistent with the instructions of the proxy. Any such proxy shall be valid 
  only with respect to the meeting and such specific matters (or with respect 
  to all matters, if so desired) as may be stated in such proxy.
* The Board may approve from time to time such reasonable attendance and other 
  requirements as it shall deem to be advisable to ensure that seats on the 
  Board are held by active, contributing individuals. Such rules may provide 
  that in the event that such requirements have not been met, a Director who 
  fails to meet such requirements shall automatically be deemed to have 
  resigned from the Board, but no such rule may be imposed retroactively.
* Project Directors appointed or nominated to the Board may be employed by
  Platinum, Gold, or Silver Corporate members even if such members have another
  Director appointed or nominated to the Board.

# Platinum Project Members

Node.js would be automatically accepted as a permanent Platinum Project Member
of the Foundation. Additional Platinum and Gold Project Members may be accepted
at any time by a Super Majority Vote of the Board that includes a majority of
the Platinum Directors.

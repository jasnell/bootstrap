## About this document

The Node.js and JS Foundations have announced an intent to merge into a single
umbrella organization hosting the combined portfolio of projects currently
under each separate organization.

The Board's of each Foundation have asked the various projects to come together
and provide specific feedback on:

* Whether the merger should proceed
* What the overall structure of a merged Foundation should look like
* How projects should be organized within a merged Foundation
* What representation projects should have on a merged Foundation's Board of
  Directors
* Suggestions for the name of the proposed new Foundation

To help with the process of organizing, drafting, and submitting the requested
feedback, the technical projects under both the Node.js and JS Foundations are
forming a temporary body (the "Node+JS Bootstrap Committee").

This document, along with the other files in this repository, are living
documents where the Committee will capture and prepare the feedback requested
by the Boards. The documents here will not represent the finalized governance
model of a merged Foundation but will serve as input into the generation of
new Foundation Bylaws and Top Level Project Charters should the merger of the
Foundations move forward.

Until such time that this group has reached consensus on a new governance
model, and the Foundation has ratified new By-laws and charters, all projects,
programs, and committees will continue to operate unchanged.

Upon enactment of a new merged Foundation, or upon decision that the merger
should not proceed, this working body will be disbanded.

### Contributing to this repository

Anyone may contribute to this repository via pull request. All individuals
holding contributor status to any Node.js Foundation or JS Foundation project,
unless voluntarily opting out, are considered members of the Bootstrap
Committee and may request commit access to this repository.

The [Code of Conduct][] explains the minimum behavior expectations required
from all contributors.

The Committee follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. Pull
Requests must have at least two sign-offs from Committee members and no
outstanding objections (or "Requests for Changes") in order to land. When there
is disagreement on any particular issue, Committee members are encouraged to
talk through the disagreement and come to a compromise resolution.

The Committee does not vote. Should it become impossible to determine consensus
on a given issue, each of the contending positions should be documented within
the repository with the arguments for and against each clearly documented for
further consideration.

### Committee Co-Chairs

Committee Co-Chairs should be selected from the available Committee Membership
following an as-yet-unagreed-upon process.

> Note: This will need to be figured out

### Committee Meetings

The Node+JS Bootstrap Committee will meet weekly at times selected for best
possible attendance. Anyone may attend the regular meetings. It will be the
Chair's responsibility to ensure every meeting has a well-defined agenda posted
at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting and that meetings are conducted in
an orderly fashion.

All meetings must be held using Zoom, must be recorded and must be broadcast to
YouTube. Minute notes must be recorded and published to this repository.

## Guiding Principles

Before the Node.js Foundation was originally launched in 2015, the project
drafted a set of [Guiding Principles][] that established the basis upon which
all of the decisions were made moving forward. We can draw on that original
set of principles here.

> The Fundamental goal of the Node.js Project is to provide a JavaScript-based
> application development platform that is *current*, *reliable* and *stable*.

This goal remains unchanged for the Node.js Project. In 2015, the Node.js
Project agreed to join the Node.js Foundation specifically to ensure the
continued ability to achieve this goal. Should the Foundation merger proceed,
this will continue to be the fundamental goal of the Node.js project.

> Contributors to Node.js work in concert with one another *on behalf* of the
> Community of userrs who build their applications and businesses on top of the
> Node.js platform. Accordingly, contributors must demonstrate an ongoing
> commitment, not only to the Project, but to the stability and vitality of
> the Community as a whole.

Node.js does not exist within a vacuum. It thrives because of the ecosystem that
it has enabled, and that has grown and thrived around it. Our responsibility is
to the entire community of JavaScript developers.

> It is vital that users trust the Contributors to have their best interests in
> mind while making decisions affecting the overall direction of the platform.
> This means having defined guidelines, stable APIs, a clear roadmap, and a
> predictable release schedule. The user community and developer ecosystem
> must be included in the decision making process.

All decisions, including those made by this Committee must be open for
discussion, debate, and consideration by the members of the community directly
impacted. This includes the decision of whether to advance forward with the
merger of the Foundations. This community values not only radical transparency,
but radical collaboration, at every level.

> Adoption of new capabilities and features within Node.js must be carefully
> balanced by the expressed needs of the users and the community. Change just
> for the sake of change must be avoided and a guaranteed long term support
> policy must be established.

Avoiding change for the sake of change applies as much to the governance and
structure of the Foundation as it does to the technical specifics of the various
projects. If we are to decide that changing the Foundation structure and merging
the two organizations is something that is in the best interests of the
community, we must be capable of articulating exactly what the benefits are
and who those benefits serve.

> Node.js owes much of its success to the existing ecosystem of module and
> add-on developers. The Node.js project should do everything it can to support
> the continued growth and stability of that ecosystem. This includes, but is
> not limited to, keeping Node.js focused on providing a minimal kernel of core
> functionality while deferring, as much as possible, additional capabilities
> and features to add-on modules or applications.

As above, the "small core" philosophy applies as much to the Governance model
as it does to the code. At no point should the Foundation and the project
leadership assume that "it knows best" when it comes to understanding what is
best for the community as a whole.

> In order to best serve the Node.js Community as a whole, the development,
> release and issue management processes adopted by the Node.js Foundation
> TSC must reflect these guiding principles.

Likewise, should the merger proceed, the structure and governance of the new
Foundation must first and foremost reflect the needs of the community,
addressing real problems faced by that community.

## What Problems Are We Trying To Solve?

TBD

## What Goals Do We Have?

* It is a goal of this committee to operate as transparently and openly as
  possible.
* It is a goal of this committee to engage with, represent the interests
  of, and advocate for the needs of the various technical projects of both
  the Node.js and JS Foundations.
* It is a goal of this committee to render an opinion about whether the
  proposed merger of the Node.js and JS Foundations is in the best short,
  mid, and long term interests of the various technical projects of both
  Foundations.
* It is a goal of this committee to provide clear and unambiguous feedback
  to the respective Boards of the Node.js and JS Foundations as to what the
  requirements and structure of a new Foundation should be to best provide
  support for the various technical projects of both Foundations.
* ... what else?

## What Concerns Have Been Raised?

The following generalized concerns have been raised and must be dealt with as
the consideration and discussion around the merger progresses:

* *Lack of transparency in the process* ... Multiple technical project members
  have expressed concerns about what they perceive as a lack of transparency
  in the discussions around a merger.
* *Lack of engagement among projects* ... Multiple technical project members
  have expressed that they either have not been made aware of the discussions
  or do not feel empowered to participate in the discussions around the
  possible merger. Several have opted to disengage from the discussions
  entirely due to a feeling that their concerns and objections will be ignored.
* *Unclear Goals* ... Multiple technical project members have expressed concerns
  that the goals of the proposed merger are unclear, specifically in terms of
  how such a merger would be of benefit to the various technical projects.
* *Unclear Timeline Motivations*... Mutiple technical project members have
  expressed concerns about the timeline that has been proposed for the execution
  of the proposed merger. For some, the process has felt "rushed" with little to
  no clear reason given as to why.
* *Disagreement with stated goals* ... Multiple technical project members have
  expressed clear disagreement with the stated goals of the proposed merger.
  Specifically, there has been objection to the idea that a joint umbrella
  organization would be in the best interests of the Node.js Project.
* *Possible loss of focus* ... Multiple technical project members have
  expressed concerns that an umbrella organization will be inadequately
  capable of focusing on the specific needs of individual projects. Several
  have pointed at various dysfunctional aspects of the current JS Foundation
  organizational and operational struture as evidence of that concern.

Note that these concerns may not be shared by all members of the technical
projects.

Additional concerns as noted in the
[Node.js Foundation + JS Foundation Intent To Merge][] presentation given
at Node+JS Interactive 2018 in Vancouver:

* Projects want to preserve autonomous governance
* Projects want to maintain independent presence
* Projects want ability to exist in foundation without additional politics
* Projects want to maintain current access to resources in larger structure
* Node.js wants continued allocation of travel fund
* Identify staffing to run merged entity
* Changes to community board representation
* Potential loss of focus on Node.js
* Optics that merge is further along than it is
* What is CommComm's role in broader focused foundation
* Minimize organizational complexity and level of bureaucracy

## Foundation Structure Proposals

TBD

### Draft Foundation Mission Statements

At the Node.js Collaborator Summit held in Vancouver, Oct 2018, a handful of
collaborators worked through a sample exercise to draft possible new mission
statements for a joint Foundation. Ultimately, the Bootstrap Committee should
recommend a *single* mission statement to the Foundation:

The drafts put together during the Vancouver exercise were:

* "By providing structure and support to build and sustain community among
  open-source projects"
* "Growing and maintaining the global JavaScript system through open,
  equitable, and inclusive governance."
* "The Foundation is dedicated to the development and sustainability of the
  JavaScript ecosystem, through fostering the environment for growth of
  JavaScript-related projects."

Additional work and discussion will be necessary to settle on a single mission
statement.
